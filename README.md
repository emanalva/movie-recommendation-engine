# Movie-Recommendation-Engine

Repo used to store my movie recommendation engine project.

## Directories

- [README.md](README.md): This file, containing the project overview, directory structure, and credits.
- [cosine_similarity.py](cosine_similarity.py): Script that computes the cosine similarity between different movies based on their attributes for content-based recommendations.
- [movie_dataset.csv](movie_dataset.csv): The dataset containing movie information, used by the recommendation engine to make predictions.
- [movie_recommender.py](movie_recommender.py): The main script that runs the recommendation engine. This includes both the popularity-based and content-based recommendation logic.
- [movie_recommender_starter.py](movie_recommender_starter.py): A starter script providing a simpler, more basic version of the recommendation engine for initial testing and experimentation.

## Project Overview

Scripts and files for a movie recommendation engine: Uses machine learning techniques to recommend movies based on user preferences.

1. **Popularity-Based Recommendations**: Recommend items based on their popularity and current trends.
2. **Content-Based Recommendations**: Recommend items similar to those the user has liked in the past, based on item attributes.

## Credits

This project was inspired by and follows the tutorial from [Code Heroku](https://www.codeheroku.com). I followed the tutorial closely while developing this project, and much of the code is based on their guidance.
