Uses machine learning techniques to recommend movies based on user preferences.
1. Popularity-Based Recommendations: Recommend items based on their popularity and current trends.
2. Content-Based Recommendations: Recommend items similar to those the user has liked in the past, based on item attributes.
<!--3. Collaborative Filtering Recommendations: Recommend items based on user similarity. For example, if Person A and Person B both like Item 1, and Person A also likes Item 2, recommend Item 2 to Person B. ##############LONG TERM GOAL WITH MORE USERS AND DATA##############-->
